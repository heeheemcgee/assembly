# assembly
 This code is a heuristic to assemble contigs from a randomized set of genome reads. 
It's all in package main, so you'll need to "go build" and "go run ." in cmd to run the code after you've cd'ed into the folder.
The error rate, allignment parameters, overlap threshold, and max transitivity can all be changed to see different results
